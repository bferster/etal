		<p><b>èt • al</b> is a new web-app that brings a people-centered approach to virtual meetings, as well as a sense of space. You go to a website that your host has created to serve the meeting’s needs, with any number of virtual meeting rooms and a virtual hallway.</p>
		<p>Each attendee has a little icon of their face, showing where they are in the conference. When you move your own icon,the other attendees will see your image move on their screens. Clicking on a room lets you join the presentation via Zoom or live-streaming.</p>
		<p>The central hallway provides an opportunity to connect with the other attendees. You can click on their icons, to see their "business card," which brings up information about them, including their website and LinkedIn page.</p>
		<p>When you see someone you want to connect with, you can chat with them by typing, speaking, or using preset responses. You can then invite them to video chat and connect, using our built-in video tool, where you can invite others to join you.</p>
		<p>You can also serendipitously meet people at the various "coffee bars" in the rooms, where group video chats are always on. When you want some privacy you can go into the quiet area which shields you from view and any incoming chat requests.</p>
		<p>You can have any number of virtual "floors," each individually styled. You might add an exhibit hall, and clicking on it would open a new floor containing any number of exhibitor's "booths." </p>
		<p>Each booth, in turn, can open up an exhibitor's uniquely styled area, where they could offer demos, videos, information, a chance to chat one-on-one with a sales or technical support person.</p>
		<p>The meeting schedule dynamically controls what happens in each of the rooms throughout the conference. You can choose the events you want to be reminded to attend, and it constantly updates what’s happening in the various rooms.</p>
